==============================================================================
This is a Kaggle Challenge -
Written in python 3 and provided as .ipynb Jupyter Notebook file
Works directly in a Google Colab

The Challenge:
Coming up with a decent model for Wine Quality Prediction by comparing
various AI/ML models and their results.

The Dataset:
Leverage the Spanish Wine Quality Data Set from UC Irvine
It is available on Kaggle or from UCI Machine Learning repository
the data is available as two csv (with ';' as separators) at:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/
one is about red wine the other about white wine

The What:
This is a Supervised Learning problem
we will apply multiple ML algorithms to real life data by fitting simple models.
This is provided as a Google Collab .ipynb Jupyter Notebook file
I decided to test several models against each other on this problem, such as:
svm, tree, linear_model, neighbors, naive_bayes, gaussian_process. . .

My Personal Goal:
build something from scratch as a Kaggle challenge solution and Compare various
ML models, list key statistical metrics (Accuracy, F1, Precision, Recall,..)
to make this comparison.
Note: My goal was not to optimize the data much with more feature engineering.
This could be a next step to improve the overall accuracy of these models

Finally this file is self-contained you do not need to procure the dataset.
I already access it online from the code. Just run it.

Have fun with it!
